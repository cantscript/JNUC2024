### "Databrokers"

During the session we mentioned what I refered to as "Databrokers". These are companies whose business it is to manipulate data from one source and provision accounts in other services. 

Using a databroker will limit the stress and interaction with SIS or idP systems when pulling in data for the all important automations. 

Below are 2 such "databrokers" that are listed on our Jamf Marketplace and have Jamf School integrations right out of the box

**Wonde** <br>
*Wonde, simplifies school data management by providing a secure, efficient, and easy-to-use platform. It connects school to over 60 data systems with 600 third-party applications globally to enhance functionality and streamline administrative processes.*
